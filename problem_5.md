# Building a Trie in Python

Before we start let us reiterate the key components of a Trie or Prefix Tree. A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings. Tries are commonly used to facilitate operations like predictive text or autocomplete features on mobile phones or web search.

Before we move into the autocomplete function we need to create a working trie for storing strings.  We will create two classes:
* A `Trie` class that contains the root node (empty string)
* A `TrieNode` class that exposes the general functionality of the Trie, like inserting a word or finding the node which represents a prefix.

Give it a try by implementing the `TrieNode` and `Trie` classes below!


```python
## Represents a single node in the Trie
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_word = False
        self.children = {}
    
    def insert(self, char):
        self.children[char] = TrieNode()
        
## The Trie itself containing the root node and insert/find functions
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        current_node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in current_node.children:
                current_node.insert(char)
            current_node = current_node.children[char]
            
        current_node.is_word = True

    def find(self, prefix):
        current_node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in current_node.children:
                return False
            current_node = current_node.children[char]
        
        return current_node

```

# Finding Suffixes

Now that we have a functioning Trie, we need to add the ability to list suffixes to implement our autocomplete feature.  To do that, we need to implement a new function on the `TrieNode` object that will return all complete word suffixes that exist below it in the trie.  For example, if our Trie contains the words `["fun", "function", "factory"]` and we ask for suffixes from the `f` node, we would expect to receive `["un", "unction", "actory"]` back from `node.suffixes()`.

Using the code you wrote for the `TrieNode` above, try to add the suffixes function below. (Hint: recurse down the trie, collecting suffixes as you go.)


```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.is_word = False
        self.children = {}
    
    def insert(self, char):
        self.children[char] = TrieNode()
        
    def suffixes(self, suffix = ''):
        ## Recursive function that collects the suffix for 
        ## all complete words below this point
        suffix_list = []
        if self.is_word:
            suffix_list.append(suffix)
        for key in self.children.keys():
            suffix_list += self.children[key].suffixes(suffix + key)
        
        return suffix_list

```

# Testing it all out

Run the following code to add some words to your trie and then use the interactive search box to see what your code returns.


```python
MyTrie = Trie()
wordList = [
    "ant", "anthology", "antagonist", "antonym", 
    "fun", "function", "factory", 
    "trie", "trigger", "trigonometry", "tripod"
]
for word in wordList:
    MyTrie.insert(word)
```


```python
from ipywidgets import widgets
from IPython.display import display
from ipywidgets import interact
def f(prefix):
    if prefix != '':
        prefixNode = MyTrie.find(prefix)
        if prefixNode:
            print('\n'.join(prefixNode.suffixes()))
        else:
            print(prefix + " not found")
    else:
        print('')
interact(f,prefix='');
```
